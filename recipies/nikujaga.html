    <p>
      Nikujaga is a Japanese dish that literally means "meat and potatoes" in
      English. It is a type of stew made with sliced beef, potatoes, onions, and
      carrots cooked in a sweetened soy sauce and mirin (a sweet rice wine)
      broth. Other ingredients such as shirataki noodles, green beans, and
      mushrooms may also be added depending on the recipe. Nikujaga is a popular
      comfort food in Japan and is often served as a main dish with rice and
      miso soup.
