    <h2>Frybread - Native American bread!</h2>
    <p>
      Frybread is a traditional Native American food that is essentially a
      flatbread made by deep-frying a dough made from flour, salt, water, and
      sometimes baking powder. The dough is typically rolled or stretched out
      into a circular or oblong shape and then fried in hot oil until it becomes
      puffy and golden brown on the outside with a fluffy interior. Frybread can
      be served plain or topped with a variety of sweet or savory toppings such
      as honey, powdered sugar, cinnamon, jam, or fruit for a sweet version, or
      with ground beef, beans, cheese, lettuce, tomatoes, and other toppings for
      a savory version. Frybread is often served at powwows, festivals, and
      other Native American gatherings and is an important part of Native
      American culture and cuisine.

    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
      <li>
        In a large mixing bowl, combine the flour, baking powder, and salt. Mix
        well.
      </li>
      <li>
        Gradually add the warm water, stirring with a wooden spoon or your
        hands, until the mixture comes together to form a smooth dough. Knead
        the dough for a few minutes until it is no longer sticky.
      </li>
      <li>
        Cover the bowl with a damp towel and let the dough rest for about 15
        minutes.
      </li>
      <li>
        Meanwhile, in a large skillet, cook the ground beef or turkey over
        medium-high heat until browned and cooked through, breaking it up into
        small pieces as it cooks.
      </li>
      <li>
        Add the chopped onion and garlic to the skillet and cook for a few
        minutes until softened.
      </li>
      <li>
        Stir in the chili powder, cumin, paprika, and oregano, and cook for
        another minute or two until fragrant. Season with salt and pepper to
        taste.
      </li>
      <li>
        In another large skillet, heat about an inch of vegetable oil over
        medium-high heat until hot.
      </li>
      <li>
        Divide the dough into 8-10 equal pieces and roll each piece out into a
        flat circle or oval, about 1/4 inch thick.
      </li>
      <li>
        Carefully place one or two pieces of the dough into the hot oil and fry
        until golden brown on both sides, flipping once. Repeat with the
        remaining dough pieces.
      </li>
      <li>Drain the fried dough on paper towels and keep warm.</li>
      <li>
        To assemble the frybread tacos, place a spoonful of the ground beef
        mixture onto each piece of frybread, followed by some shredded lettuce,
        diced tomatoes, shredded cheese, salsa, and sour cream.
      </li>
      <li>Serve hot and enjoy!</li>
